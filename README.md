# teatime

Timer for tea

Usage:

```
teatime <minutes>
```

It will notify showing the following image that the minutes you have specified have passed

![tea time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordiprats/teatime/master/alarm.bmp "It's tea time!")

You can leave this command on any virtual desktop, the image will show up in any desktop you are working on

This is a rewrite of something I coded around 2006 but forgot to upload somewhere to keep it
